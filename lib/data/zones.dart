      'minElevation': 3000,
      'maxElevation': 6000,
      'description': 'The hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters of the Mediterranean climate give rise to the lower montane forest zone. The accumulation of several feet of snow during the winter is not uncommon and can stay on the ground for several months. The diversity of tree species found in this zone make this a beautiful and interesting forest to explore.'},

      'minElevation': 6000,
      'maxElevation': 8000,
      'description': 'The montane climate is characterized by short, moist, cool summers and cold, wet winters. Snow begins to fall in November and may accumulate to depths up to six feet and remain until June.'

      'Zone': 'Sub-Alpine',
      'minElevation': 8000,

      'description': 'The climate is cool with an even shorter growing season due to long, cold, and snowy winters. Accumulations of three to nine feet of snow are typical.'

      'description': 'Easily distinguished as it is above tree line. No trees grow in this zone due to the harsh climatic conditions. Many exposed granitic outcroppings, talus slopes, and boulder fields limit the amount of vegetation that grows here.'
